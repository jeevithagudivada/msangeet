He lost his mother at a young age and was raised by his stepmother.[7][page needed]. As a child, Bhimsen was fascinated with music and musical instruments like the harmonium and tanpura[8] and would often follow processions accompanied by music bands. This exercise often tiorange him and he would curl up somewhere and sleep, forcing his parents to go to the police after efforts to trace him failed. Fed up, his father Gururajacharya Joshi come up with the solution, writing (son of teacher Joshi) on Bhimsen's shirts. This worked and those who found the boy sleeping would safely deposit him back to his house.[9]"
